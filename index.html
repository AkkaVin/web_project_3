                    springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was
                    in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than
                    its neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.

                    sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you,
                    the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world
                    proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland
                    headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged,
                    waterproof boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for
                    unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing
                    through the Appalachians. These boots are also better than

                    Most likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark
                    on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a

                    From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline
                    of Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are
                    surprisingly common in this particular region of North
                    America, over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude
                    of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the
                    only thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the
                    country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting
                    to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably
                    be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete
                    (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to
                    ride as many roller coasters as you can before continue your
                    bike ride!
